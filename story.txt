Dresden2 Team Story

Today I woke up and thought about the Head Cinema, and a crazy idea occurred to me! 

I went to the airport to visit the world's larget beer garden.

I got there by driving my BMW on the Hauptstrasse.

On the way I saw the CRAZIEST THING!...a Castle in the air!

So I sat back and ate my German sausage while I stared at the castle.
